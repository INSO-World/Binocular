/**
 * Mapper for File domain objects.
 *
 * Converts between File domain objects and FileEntity persistence entities for ArangoDB.
 * This is a **simple mapper** - it only handles basic conversion without orchestrating
 * complex relationships.
 *
 * ## Design Principles
 * - **Single Responsibility**: Only converts File structure
 * - **No Deep Traversal**: Does not map file states, commits, or branches
 *
 * ## Usage
 * This mapper is typically called by infrastructure ports and assemblers. It supports
 * bidirectional conversion between domain and entity representations.
